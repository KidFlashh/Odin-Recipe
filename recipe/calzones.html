        <p>A calzone is an Italian dish that features a circular piece of pizza or yeasted bread dough that's folded in half over a filling that includes ricotta, and often mozzarella and Parmesan, too, cured meats, vegetables and herbs, then sealed shut using a crimping technique</p>

        <ul>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry milk powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¾ cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>4 ounces pepperoni sausage, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water, salt, bread flour, dry milk, sugar, and yeast in the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle.</li>
            <li>When the cycle has finished, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface; shape it into a 16x10-inch rectangle. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together chopped pepperoni and mozzarella. Spoon pizza sauce in a stripe down the center of dough lengthwise; add pepperoni and cheese filling. Make diagonal cuts 1 1/2 inches apart down each side, cutting within a 1/2 inch of the filling. Criss-cross strips over filling, sealing with water. Brush top with melted butter.</li>
            <li>Bake calzone in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
